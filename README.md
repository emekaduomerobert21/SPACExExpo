Mission Metrics: Analyzing SpaceX Launches


This project delves into SpaceX's launch data to uncover key insights about their missions, payloads, and outcomes. Through detailed exploratory data analysis, interactive dashboards, and predictive modeling, we aim to answer critical questions about the success rates, payload capacities, and landing outcomes of SpaceX missions.

Using tools such as Python, SQL, and Folium for geospatial visualization, the project identifies patterns in launch performance across different sites and booster versions. It also predicts mission outcomes based on payload data and other key factors, offering a comprehensive perspective on SpaceX's advancements in space exploration.

The findings not only shed light on the factors contributing to SpaceX's success but also provide a template for leveraging data analytics in aerospace innovation. This project combines technical rigor with accessible visual storytelling to present actionable insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.
